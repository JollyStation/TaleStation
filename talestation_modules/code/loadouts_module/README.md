# Loadouts Module

The Loadouts Module contains information pertaining to the loadouts feature in game.

### WHEN ADDING NEW THINGS:
If you plan to add to the list, please follow this sorting criteria:

### Organize the item based off its name:
If an item starts with an adjective (i.e green shoes), use shoes as a base line, and alphabetize the colors.
Example:

| Incorrect | Correct 
| ----- | -----
| Yellow Shoes | Blue Shoes
| Orange Shoes | Green Shoes
| Blue Shoes | Orange Shoes
| Green Shoes | Yellow Shoes

### Organize the item based off its first noun/adjective:
If an item starts with a noun (i.e maids apron), organize it based on the first noun. If the first noun is primarily an adjective, sort it by putting adjectives first THEN nouns.

### Sorting by first noun
| Incorrect | Correct 
| ----- | -----
| Maid Apron | Artist Apron
| Botanists Apron | Botanist Apron
| Chefs Apron | Chefs Apron
| Artists Apron | Maid Apron

### Sorting by second noun
| Incorrect | Correct 
| ----- | -----
| Yellow Apron | Green Apron
| Maid Apron | Yellow Apron
| Botanist Apron | Botanist Apron
| Green Apron | Maid Apron

### Organize the item based off its second noun
This is a rare case scenario that may happen, but the similar structures will still need to be followed as detailed above.

| Incorrect | Correct 
| ----- | -----
| Yellow Cheongsam| Green Changshan
| Orange Cheongsam| Blue Cheongsam
| Blue Cheongsam| Orange Cheongsam
| Green Changshan| Yellow Cheongsam

Another thing to note:
Greyscale items will **ALWAYS** be listed first, no matter what. They will follow the same alphabetizing patters mentioned above.

Any questions please direct them to any maintainer.
