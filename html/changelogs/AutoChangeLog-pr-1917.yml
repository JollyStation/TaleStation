changes:
  - server: Added a configurable probability for nonhuman species to spawn in the
      morgue at round start!
  - bugfix: Adminspawned morgue cadavers will now only spawn inside closed morguetrays
      (the bodies could get stuck inside them!)
  - bugfix: Morguetrays are now less likely to end up having multiple cadavers in
      them.
