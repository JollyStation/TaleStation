changes:
  - bugfix: "fixed give_important_for_life proc in species.dm, which is supposed to be used to help ensure plasmamen (and potentially other races) are always spawned with internals and such"
  - bugfix: "fixed issue where plasmamen who are spawned without a plasmaman-specific job outfit could spawn without internals and a suit, and just start dying immediately"
