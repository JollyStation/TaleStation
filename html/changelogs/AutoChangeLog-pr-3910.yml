changes:
  - code_imp: "rescaled supermatter health from 900 to 100."
  - balance: "we didn't do a 1:1 rescale of the damage though, atmos based damage should be slightly higher across the board but have lower caps. All external damage is slightly lower."
  - code_imp: "made the less important parts of the visual supermatter effects same between different delams so we have an easier time changing the code."
  - qol: "added a delta symbol to the SM UI on damage and energy breakdown to denote that they are actually changes instead of exact values."
