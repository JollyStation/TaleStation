      lab and not in the pharmacy again.

  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to
      a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it
      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.
  - bugfix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you were
      to use it, but instead do their own unique thing.
  - bugfix: shield wall gens actually use power now
  - qol: shield wall gens may now be rebuilt and use some balloon alerts, and have
      wiring
  - code_imp: The singularity processing is a bit more important than the other subsystems.
  - rscadd: Heterochromatic, Signer, Spacer, and Voracious quirks are now properly
      accounted for in medical records.
  - bugfix: Cyber cops are now equipped with the correct outfit.
  - rscadd: turns triple ai mode into a station trait
