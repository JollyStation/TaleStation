  TaleStationBot:
  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to

  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Falling down a z-level while standing now damages your legs rather than
      your entire body. This also means falling down multiple z-s may rarely break
      your legs.
  - rscadd: Felinids now land on their feet if they fall down a z-level while standing.

  - refactor: (Almost) all smoothed icons can now be edited in their pre cut forms
  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and
      aren't starving/malnourished when they cure.
  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.
  - balance: This does not apply to things like fungal TB; it does apply to healing
      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.
  - balance: disease can be cured through direct injection or ingestion of cured blood.
      However, curing disease in this way does not provide lasting immunity. You need
      to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine for that.
  - balance: Wearing internals or using protective equipment while infected can limit
      the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others. Contact transmission
      is still possible however.

      pharmacy access.

  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.

2023-12-13:
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: When using an item on a mob, you will always attempt to fix wounds AFTER
      surgery, BUT BEFORE the item's own interactions. As an example, this means using

      deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance to block).
  - balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon. Traitors
      can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
  - balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a normal
      shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles and nothing else).

      so on a block.
  - balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges every 10
