  TaleStationBot:
  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to
      a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it
      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.

      by examining them.

  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Falling down a z-level while standing now damages your legs rather than
      your entire body. This also means falling down multiple z-s may rarely break
      your legs.
  - rscadd: Felinids now land on their feet if they fall down a z-level while standing.

  - refactor: (Almost) all smoothed icons can now be edited in their pre cut forms
  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and
      aren't starving/malnourished when they cure.
  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.
  - balance: This does not apply to things like fungal TB; it does apply to healing
      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.
  - balance: disease can be cured through direct injection or ingestion of cured blood.
      However, curing disease in this way does not provide lasting immunity. You need
      to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine for that.
  - balance: Wearing internals or using protective equipment while infected can limit
      the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others. Contact transmission
      is still possible however.

      now get virology access on skeleton shift access. Virologists now have roundstart
      pharmacy access.

      and can always override other advanced diseases; they also have an extra bonus
      on their stealth stat to help make up for early outing without a bit more testing.
  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - rscadd: TGUI Stack elements can now be zebra-styled (alternating colors for contrast)
  - bugfix: Being revived inside a legion now sets you free
  - bugfix: "in some rare cases gib() did infact not spawn gib\n/\U0001F191"
