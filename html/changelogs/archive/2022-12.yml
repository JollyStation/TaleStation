      a bit more granularity as to when it's meant to be covered, but still visible,
      like for catwalks!
  - bugfix: Catwalks no longer are affected by ambient occlusion, and now properly
      feel like actual floor tiles.

  - bugfix: Construct actions go to the middle of the screen like expected.
  - bugfix: Fixes a runtime when alien larva exploded their host that caused the larva

  - qol: Lights now have a 2/3 chance to be off at roundstart instead of 1/2.
  TaleStationBot:
  - balance: Change liver to not purge toxins instantly for low amounts. Instead the

      does liver damage. This fixes bite increments for food, cigarettes, and drinks

  - balance: Change the formula for how toxins effect livers.  Livers will be damaged
      based on the units of toxin present and their lethality.

      value that was defined on a per-/atom level. As a consequence, such auxiliary
      effects from projectiles now actually respect the armored equipment of hit targets/limbs/etc.
      On living mobs that have armor equipped, anyway.
