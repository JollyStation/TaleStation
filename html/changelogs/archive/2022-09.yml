  - balance: makes the standard quick carry modsuit module have nitrile level carrying
      speed instead of latex level
  - rscadd: adds a medical version of the prisoner capture modsuit module, for patient
      transport, prisoner capture and patient transport now use new medical/security
      hardlight bodybags, medical one deploying them faster. and security one being
      able to be locked down. when you move too far out of range the holobag dissipates
  - rscadd: adds a defibrillator modsuit module, extends shock paddles
  - rscadd: adds a thread ripper modsuit module, this module temporarily rips away
      the matter of clothing, to allow stuff like injections, surgery, defibrillation
      etc through it
  - rscadd: adds a surgery processor modsuit module, essentially a portable surgery
      computer like borgs have

      the do_after to defib onehanded

      / runechat awareness.

      instead of an object.

      behavioral changes but should overall be the same.

      behavior.
