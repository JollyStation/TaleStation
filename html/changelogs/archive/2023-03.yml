      with it.
  - balance: Wirecarp no longer tells you what ruins spawned in a round, instead it's
      limited to PDA logs, and tells you the source too. This means the RD can catch

      the other pirate gangs earlier on.
  - bugfix: Prevented the pirate event from runtiming when no possible pirate gangs
      were available.

      quantities (6 shots). They also have more consistent pricing. 3 for normal and
      a box of surplus, and 4 for every other type.
  - balance: Reduces the range of Marksman ammo to 50 tiles. Not because it is strong,
      but because you might accidentally shoot yourself if you're not watching where
      you're shooting. Ricochets are no joke.
  - rscadd: Replaces Soporific with Disruptor ammo. Works like soporific, but also
