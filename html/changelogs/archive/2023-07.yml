  LT3:
  - qol: Context tooltip size increased
  - bugfix: Fixed remnants of old maptext code on various things
  TaleStationBot:
  - bugfix: Actions granted by equipped or held items now actually appear again
  - rscadd: Coroners are now Morbid!
  - rscadd: Coroners come with a series of special tools that are especially good
      at performing certain surgeries if used by a Morbid individual (which the coroner
      happens to be). They are found in the coroner's medkit.
  - rscadd: The sorts of surgeries they enjoy are; dissections, autospies, revival
      surgery, plastic surgery, organ/feature manipulations, amputations. Also eyesnatching.
  - rscadd: Coroners therefore hate; tending the wounds of the living, defibrillation
      and CPR. Why waste so much effort on breathers if you can't even carve them
      up a bit first?
  - rscadd: Coroners love pickles and pickle juice.
  - rscadd: The coroner can finally put their autopsy scanner into their special medkit.
      Not the compact one, though.
  - rscadd: The elephant graveyard is safer to plunder for the morbid individual.
      The rewards from the graveyard are now also slightly more lucrative...if you
      don't care about being cursed, that is.
  - balance: Roboticists get secure morgue access during skeleton shifts
  - rscadd: Food and pills have a 10% chance to infect with one of three new diseases
      on consumption when left for more than 5 seconds on the floor. You can wash
      it to avoid disease. ChemMaster and Pill Press are added to the list of elevated
      structures (Considered as tables for pills). Made harvest spawn on top of hydrotrays
      to stay protected from germs.
  - rscadd: 'Added three new advanced diseases: Gastritium, Carpellosis, Nebula Nausea
      with static cures obtained by digesting dirty food.'
  - bugfix: Food no longer decomposes on Hydrotrays, Grilles, Bonfires and all dense
      kitchen machinery
  - code_imp: Decomposition now uses `germ_sensitive` component and follows 5 second
      rule too.
  - qol: Crafted food items spawns on nearby tables (except the one behind you) instead
      of dropping on floor when hands are full.
  - qol: Add hotkeys to APCs for AIs and borgs. Toggle environmental (ctrl + shift),
      toggle lighting (shift), toggle equipment (alt), and toggle breaker (ctrl).
  - qol: Remove APC UI popup when using RMB to toggle the lock.
  - bugfix: jetpack modules work on mod suits again
  - bugfix: jetpack cyber implants also work
  - refactor: removed `get_mover` callback, user is retrieved during activation
  - refactor: timestop module on `on_module_triggered()` accepts user as 2nd param
2023-07-02:
  Chadley:
  - bugfix: fixes the EHMS injector's do_after()
  - code_imp: Improves the code for the disease scan proc (thank you fikou)
  Cheshify, Kinnebian, and RedSentry27:
  - rscadd: Maintenance engineers have sent out blueprints across the sector for a
      new laser musket.
  - admin: A new energy-gun toting ERT is available to send to the crew.
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: Fix organ damage being uncapped
  - balance: Buffed the silverscale statue every so slightly, it now has innate armor
      and can reflect lasers shot at it. But it also requires you not by lying down
      to activate.
  Seven:
  - bugfix: Cult communion and assert leadership can be used while your hands are
      blocked or you are immobile
  TaleStationBot:
  - spellcheck: Improves gas monitor reaction information RP.
  - rscadd: Stethoscopes may be used on the chest, groin, or extremities to assess
      organ damage, blood level, and/or suffocation damage depending on the targeted
      area.
  - rscadd: Shining flashlights into the mouth or eyes of other players will additionally
      assess brain health, suffocation damage, and/or blood level depending on the
      targeted area.
  - balance: Halves the duration of the flash effect from shining lights into players'
      eyes (2s -> 1s). Use combat mode to get the full duration.
  - qol: people now lie down when buckled to surgery tables, and you no longer need
      cuffs to buckle someone to a surgery table
  - balance: Jousting now works on anything you're buckled to, not just Cyborgs.
  - balance: Brooms, Pitchforks, the Captain's Sabre, and Energy swords can now be
      used for jousting.
  - balance: Spears need to travel a longer distance to joust now.
  - balance: Jousting's knockdown and damage now only gets stronger after you've traveled
      the minimum tiles needed to joust.
  - bugfix: Fix hypernoblium formation gas reaction rate sanity clamping not accounting
      for the reduction factor.
  - bugfix: Fix N2O formation gas reaction rate clamping clamping for incorrect consumption
      rates.
  - bugfix: Fix BZ formation reaction rate sanity clamping not accounting for N2O
      decomposition factor.
  - balance: Silicon now only know Common, Uncommon and Robotic languages.
  - bugfix: fixed basalt turfs remaining visually dug up when refilled by an ash storm
  - bugfix: fixed ash storm ending sounds looping after the storm is over
  - bugfix: mechs are now snow storm immune
  - bugfix: jaunt spells protect from weather when jaunting
  - bugfix: fixed shotguns not clearing their "mag" correctly
  - balance: We are now using space Monsanto brand rice/wheat seeds. Nutriment of
      both grains has been changed to 12% from 4%
  - bugfix: Fixes some fuck with duffelbags, them not holding enough + issues with
      spawning gear in them (job shit and all)
  - bugfix: Fixed the office chair being silent. My bad.
  Vekter:
  - balance: Increased armor penetration on xenos' neurotoxin spit. Well-protected
      crew members should still take more than a few hits to down but shouldn't be
      immune to it.
  - balance: Adds a build time to window types which didn't have ones before.
  - bugfix: Fixed the ORM not granting mining points if you added ore by hand instead
      of dumping it on the floor.
