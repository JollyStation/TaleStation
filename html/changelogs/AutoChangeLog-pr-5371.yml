changes:
  - admin: Admins can now control the spawn location, potency, production and starting
      mutations of the space vines event.
  - bugfix: The space vine event will now correctly give vines mutations when they
      spawn rather than always being mutation free.
  - code_imp: Checkbox tgui inputs now support setting a minimum number of inputs
      rather than it being hardcoded to 1.
