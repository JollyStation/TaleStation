changes:
  - refactor: All four SM delams got recoded, no significant gameplay changes expected.
  - code_imp: Only engines considered to be a main engine can spawn stationwide anomalies
      and trigger cascades.
  - bugfix: Fixed the sm not having a boxy overlay on normal delams when counting
      down. This is what the radio message was referring to as "causality field".
