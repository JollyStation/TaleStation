changes:
  - balance: Scatter laser shells actually utilize the _real_ scatter laser beam.
      This comes with damage changes. And wounding power.
  - refactor: All projectiles can now have damage falloff defined. Yay.
  - balance: Scatter laser shells can be printed when weapons technology is researched.
