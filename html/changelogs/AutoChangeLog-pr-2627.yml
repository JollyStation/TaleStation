  - bugfix: 'Whenever you put a species with some type of exotic, non-human blood
      on a surgery table: the corresponding blood type should no longer report it
      as if the patient in question had a Rhesus blood type, and will instead declare
      the name of the actual reagent circulating within their system.'
