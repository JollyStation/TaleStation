changes:
  - balance: You can no longer upgrade your tablets to have signals to the NTnet despite
      not being anywhere near telecomms. Instead, the Mining base has a lesser connection,
      and all computers have Ethernet connections.
  - balance: All tablets now have a printer in them, rather than it being an external
      part.
