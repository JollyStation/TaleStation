changes:
  - refactor: Refactored the way the undertile component works, to allow it to have
      a bit more granularity as to when it's meant to be covered, but still visible,
      like for catwalks!
  - bugfix: Catwalks no longer are affected by ambient occlusion, and now properly
      feel like actual floor tiles.
