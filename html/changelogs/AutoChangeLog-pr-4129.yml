changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored blindness and nearsightedness. Important to note is that all mobs are naturally blind until their eyes are actually created."
  - refactor: "Refactored \"is covered\" procs"
  - bugfix: "Less sources of blindness now cause permanent blindness. Includes the \"Blind\" Spell and \"Blind Sting\" from changelings."
  - admin: "Ahealing someone no longer flashes the blind overlay for 1 tick."
  - admin: "I removed an unused (sort of) inaccessible admin verb that allowed you to toggle the tint from all welding helmets (and clothing) (and lack of eyes) in existence, let me know if you want similar back"
  - balance: "Changeling \"Blind Sting\" now causes eye damage (enough to blind) rather than arbitrarily forcing blindness."
  - balance: "Visionloss virus symptom now causes eye damage (enough to blind) rather than arbitrarily forcing blindness."
  - balance: "Oculine has been reworked slightly. Prior, Oculine arbitrarily healed blindness and nearsightedness from eye damage reagrdless of how damaged the eyes were, and applied blur on success. Now, Oculine just heals eye damage, and blindness / nearsightedness is restored in the process. There is now a probability every tick that eye blur is applied based on how pure the oculine is while healing very damaged eyes."
  - balance: "Pacifists can no longer eyestab."
  - balance: "Any clothing item that covers your eyes contributes to getting the bonus while sleeping, and to removing temporary blindness faster"
