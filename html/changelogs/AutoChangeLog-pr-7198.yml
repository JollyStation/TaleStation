changes:
  - balance: Fishing without a bait will only lower the odds (a smidge less, too)
      of catching fish, not other things.
  - balance: Catching something that isn't a fish or a living mob won't consume the
      bait anymore.
  - balance: The Bepis fishing rod will now ignore fish's bait preferences.
