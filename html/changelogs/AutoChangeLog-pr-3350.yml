changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploit involving igniters attached to themselves. Assembly holders
      are now limited to 12 assemblies maximum, and you cannot attach multiple igniters
      to the same assembly.
  - refactor: Refactored some assembly jank, namely in how they pulse and are pulsed.
