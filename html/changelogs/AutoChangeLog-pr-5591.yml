changes:
  - balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and the victim
      to hold still for half a second before activating, so you can't hold-up people
      fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will briefly immobilize the both of
      you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops
      are immune to the immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.
  - balance: Holding someone up will immediately apply a 1.25x damage and wound multiplier,
      rather than waiting 2.5 seconds to hit 2x.
  - soundadd: Being held up will now make the victim play a sharp gasp sound, a la
      Metal Gear Solid.
