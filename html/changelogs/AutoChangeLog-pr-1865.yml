changes:
  - balance: Nanotrasen realized that the more access they had on their cards was
      costing them a pretty penny, so they trimmed back the number of accesses a certain
      departmental Security Guard might have. However, any given guard will get back
      a greater amount of accesses depending on how many security guards there are
      in relation to the population.
  - config: Hey server operators, listen! We've changed up how Departmental Security
      Officers get their accesses, so be sure to review the DEPSEC_ACCESS_LEVEL config
      number to see what you want to work best for your server.
