changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item. It spawns a dapper monkey
      that must follow your orders.
  - rscadd: Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns! Though
      they aren't very powerful.
  - refactor: Added a more modularlike subtype for antagonist spawners to reduce future
      hardcoding.
