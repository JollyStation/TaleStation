  - qol: "Gigabeacons no longer need to be constructed like standard machines, instead being printed as items that can be deployed quickly inhand without tools."
  - qol: "Gigabeacons are no longer their own research node, instead being a part of telecomms tech (due to the fact they're RADIO navigation beacons)"
  - image: "Navigation gigabeacons now have their own unique sprites, inspired by maritime EPIRB devices. If you find a yellow box with an antenna on it, you probably found a nav beacon!"
  - code_imp: "The deployable component now gives you an option to disable the examine blurb it adds to its parent"
