changes:
  - bugfix: All player controlled simple animals now show a death chat broadcast when
      they die again.
  - bugfix: Living mobs cannot die while they are dead. Also fixes a bug where dead
      player controlled mobs will spam death chat broadcasts.
  - code_imp: Dehardcoded an exact type check for areas which shouldn't show death
      chat messages (CTF)
