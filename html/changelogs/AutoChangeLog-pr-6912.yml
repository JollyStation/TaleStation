changes:
  - bugfix: Fix robotic organs to not gain health passively, from revival, smart organ
      fridge, pluxium, occuline, and earmuffs.
  - rscadd: Some diseases now require the appropriate internal organ to work. A robotic
      organ will give immunity to the disease symptom unless the disease has "Inorganic
      Biology".
  - rscadd: Disease transmission methods now require an internal organ to be successful.
      Robotic organs give immunity. (except inorganic biology) Airborne disease transmission
      require lungs. Ingested (drunk or eaten) disease transmission requires a stomach.
      Blood (inject or patch) disease transmission requires a heart.
  - rscadd: Organs removed from a mob that is afflicted with a disease will be infectious
      while handling or transplanting it. (again, robotic organs are immune unless
      inorganic biology is present) Certain admin spawned or special diseases are
      exempt from this transmission method.
  - rscadd: A stomach is required for nebula nausea, gastritium, carpellosis, metabolic
      boost, vomit, weight loss, death sandwich poisoning
  - rscadd: Lungs are required for choking, asphyxiation, cough, cold9, oxygen restoration,
      sneezing, flu, cold, spanish flu, tuberculosis
  - rscadd: A liver is required for tissue hydration, plasma fixation, parasitic infection
  - rscadd: Ears are required for deafness, sensory restoration
  - rscadd: A heart is required for toxolysis, heart failure
  - rscadd: Eyes are required for sensory restoration, hyphema
  - rscadd: A tongue is required for voice change, pierrot throat
