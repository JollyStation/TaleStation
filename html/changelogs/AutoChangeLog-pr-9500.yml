changes:
  - rscadd: Added ore vents. Scanning them with mining scanners shows what minerals
      they contain. Scan again to fight off a horde of beasts as your drone assistant
      excavates the vent, so the ore vent will produce mineral boulders!
  - rscadd: Added the BRM, Refinery, and Smelter. These pieces of equipment are used
      to process ore boulders into minerals for the station. Stock Part upgrades allow
      more boulders to be processed at one time. They collect mining points as well,
      to be redeemed with an  ID card swipe.
  - rscadd: Boulders are teleported to the station via the BRM if left untouched.
      Boulders can also be cracked open for a reduced amount of ore using pickaxes
      or golems hands.
  - rscadd: All stations come equipt with a pre-excavated ore vent, which produces
      a basic supply of iron and glass only. Scan other vents for your critical resources!
  - rscadd: "Look there's a shit ton of changes on mining, for more detail check out\
