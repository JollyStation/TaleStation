changes:
  - rscadd: Aquariums now have a small internal reagent holder, accessible when the
      panel is open and used to automatically feed the fishes at selectable intervals,
      also compatible with plumbing.
  - rscadd: Fish catalogs can now be bought as a goodie pack, for 25 cr, or rarely
      found at the library or maints.
  - bugfix: Fixed the prices of fish analyzers. It's supposed to be 150 cr, not 500.
  - balance: Moved the aquarium kit and fish supply packs from the "General" section
      to "Service" and "Livestock" respectively, meaning they can be ordered for free
      from the service orders console.
